# yachimata_cube
solver can solve the yachimata cube. use the function solve(l) where l is the orientation of the first brick.
first brick gets laid and than it tries to combine all the  others until it finds the orientations in which they all fit.
it will find a solution for l = 3 for example but there are many more.

cube is just a framework

orientations is the blocks hardcoded there you can see which block has which ID. and from that it builds a list with all blocks in all orientations i could imagine.
